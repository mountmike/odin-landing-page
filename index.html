            <h1>Genesis Ballet Studio</h1>
            <p>Ballet is the perfect foundation for any child who wants to learn how to dance. Not only will they learn how to respond to music, how to follow instructions from the teacher, and how to work together with their new friends—they’ll also learn how to improve their posture, coordination, social skills, and confidence.</p>

        <p>We have had the pleasure of taking ballet classes with Ms. Amy for two of our daughters. Amy is kind, patient, and very talented. She has helped our oldest daughter with her focus, listening, and perseverance. She has helped our second daughter improve her confidence and find a real passion for dance. Both girls absolutely love taking class with Ms. Amy - it is the highlight of their week! We look forward to following Amy to her new studio and will be signing up all 3 of our girls in her classes.”
